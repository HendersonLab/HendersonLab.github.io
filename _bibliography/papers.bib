  abstract = {The liver has a unique ability to regenerate1,2; however, in the setting of acute liver failure (ALF), this regenerative capacity is often overwhelmed, leaving emergency liver transplantation as the only curative option3–5. Here, to advance understanding of human liver regeneration, we use paired single-nucleus RNA sequencing combined with spatial profiling of healthy and ALF explant human livers to generate a single-cell, pan-lineage atlas of human liver regeneration. We uncover a novel ANXA2+ migratory hepatocyte subpopulation, which emerges during human liver regeneration, and a corollary subpopulation in a mouse model of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver regeneration. Interrogation of necrotic wound closure and hepatocyte proliferation across multiple timepoints following APAP-induced liver injury in mice demonstrates that wound closure precedes hepatocyte proliferation. Four-dimensional intravital imaging of APAP-induced mouse liver injury identifies motile hepatocytes at the edge of the necrotic area, enabling collective migration of the hepatocyte sheet to effect wound closure. Depletion of hepatocyte ANXA2 reduces hepatocyte growth factor-induced human and mouse hepatocyte migration in vitro, and abrogates necrotic wound closure following APAP-induced mouse liver injury. Together, our work dissects unanticipated aspects of liver regeneration, demonstrating an uncoupling of wound closure and hepatocyte proliferation and uncovering a novel migratory hepatocyte subpopulation that mediates wound closure following liver injury. Therapies designed to promote rapid reconstitution of normal hepatic microarchitecture and reparation of the gut–liver barrier may advance new areas of therapeutic discovery in regenerative medicine.},

  abstract = {Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. MASLD can progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) with subsequent liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma formation. The advent of current technologies such as single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing have transformed our understanding of the liver in homeostasis and disease. The next frontier is contextualizing this single-cell information in its native spatial orientation. This understanding will markedly accelerate discovery science in hepatology, resulting in a further step-change in our knowledge of liver biology and pathobiology. In this Review, we discuss up-to-date knowledge of MASLD development and progression and how the burgeoning field of spatial genomics is driving exciting new developments in our understanding of human liver disease pathogenesis and therapeutic target identification.},

   Abstract={The human endometrium experiences repetitive cycles of tissue wounding characterised by piecemeal shedding of the surface epithelium and rapid restoration of tissue homeostasis. In this study we used a mouse model of endometrial repair and three transgenic lines of mice to investigate whether epithelial cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium have their origins in one or more of the mesenchymal cell types present in the stromal compartment of the endometrium. Using scRNAseq we identified a novel population of PDGFRb+ mesenchymal stromal cells that developed a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometrial breakdown/repair. These cells expressed genes usually considered specific to epithelial cells and in silico trajectory analysis suggested they were stromal fibroblasts in transition to becoming epithelial cells. To confirm our hypothesis we used a lineage tracing strategy to compare the fate of stromal fibroblasts (PDGFRa+) and stromal perivascular cells (NG2/CSPG4+). We demonstrated that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transformation and become incorporated into the re-epithelialised luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings form a platform for comparisons both to endometrial pathologies which involve a fibrotic response (Asherman's syndrome, endometriosis) as well as other mucosal tissues which have a variable response to wounding.}

   Abstract={The development of stable specialized cell types in multicellular organisms relies on mechanisms controlling inductive intercellular signals and the competence of cells to respond to such signals. In developing cerebral cortex, progenitors generate only glutamatergic excitatory neurons despite being exposed to signals with the potential to initiate the production of other neuronal types, suggesting that their competence is limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this limitation is due to their expression of transcription factor Pax6. We used bulk and single-cell RNAseq to show that conditional cortex-specific Pax6 deletion from the onset of cortical neurogenesis allowed some progenitors to generate abnormal lineages resembling those normally found outside the cortex. Analysis of selected gene expression showed that the changes occurred in specific spatiotemporal patterns. We then compared the responses of control and Pax6-deleted cortical cells to in vivo and in vitro manipulations of extracellular signals. We found that Pax6 loss increased cortical progenitors' competence to generate inappropriate lineages in response to extracellular factors normally present in developing cortex, including the morphogens Shh and Bmp4. Regional variation in the levels of these factors could explain spatiotemporal patterns of fate change following Pax6 deletion in vivo. We propose that Pax6's main role in developing cortical cells is to minimize the risk of their development being derailed by the potential side effects of morphogens engaged contemporaneously in other essential functions.}

   Abstract={The liver is a multitasking organ with essential functions for vertebrate health spanning metabolism and immunity. In contrast to mammals, our understanding of liver cellular heterogeneity and its role in regulating immunological status remains poorly defined in fishes. Addressing this knowledge gap, we generated a transcriptomic atlas of 47,432 nuclei isolated from the liver of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) contrasting control fish with those challenged with a pathogenic strain of Aeromonas salmonicida, a problematic bacterial pathogen in global aquaculture. We identified the major liver cell types and their sub-populations, revealing poor conservation of many hepatic cell marker genes utilized in mammals, while identifying novel heterogeneity within the hepatocyte, lymphoid, and myeloid lineages. This included polyploid hepatocytes, multiple T cell populations including γδ T cells, and candidate populations of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells. A dominant hepatocyte population radically remodeled its transcriptome following infection to activate the acute phase response and other defense functions, while repressing routine functions such as metabolism. These defense-specialized hepatocytes showed strong activation of genes controlling protein synthesis and secretion, presumably to support the release of acute phase proteins into circulation. The infection response further involved up-regulation of numerous genes in an immune-cell specific manner, reflecting functions in pathogen recognition and killing, antigen presentation, phagocytosis, regulation of inflammation, B cell differentiation and T cell activation. Overall, this study greatly enhances our understanding of the multifaceted role played by liver immune and non-immune cells in host defense and metabolic remodeling following infection and provides many novel cell-specific marker genes to empower future studies of this organ in fishes.}

   Abstract={Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is reaching epidemic proportions, with a global prevalence of 25% in the adult population. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to cirrhosis, has become the leading indication for liver transplantation in both Europe and the USA. Liver fibrosis is the consequence of sustained, iterative liver injury, and the main determinant of outcomes in NASH. The liver possesses remarkable inherent plasticity, and liver fibrosis can regress when the injurious agent is removed, thus providing opportunities to alter long-term outcomes through therapeutic interventions. Although hepatocyte injury is a key driver of NASH, multiple other cell lineages within the hepatic fibrotic niche play major roles in the perpetuation of inflammation, mesenchymal cell activation, extracellular matrix accumulation as well as fibrosis resolution. The constituents of this cellular interactome, and how the various subpopulations within the fibrotic niche interact to drive fibrogenesis is an area of active research. Important cellular components of the fibrotic niche include endothelial cells, macrophages, passaging immune cell populations and myofibroblasts. In this review, we will describe how rapidly evolving technologies such as single-cell genomics, spatial transcriptomics and single-cell ligand-receptor analyses are transforming our understanding of the cellular interactome in NAFLD/NASH, and how this new, high-resolution information is being leveraged to develop rational new therapies for patients with NASH.}

   Abstract={Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction drives the initiation and pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We aimed to characterize EC dynamics in PAH at single-cell resolution.\\ We carried out single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of lung ECs isolated from an EC lineage-tracing mouse model in Control and SU5416/hypoxia-induced PAH conditions. EC populations corresponding to distinct lung vessel types, including two discrete capillary populations, were identified in both Control and PAH mice. Differential gene expression analysis revealed global PAH-induced EC changes that were confirmed by bulk RNA-seq. This included upregulation of the major histocompatibility complex class II pathway, supporting a role for ECs in the inflammatory response in PAH. We also identified a PAH response specific to the second capillary EC population including upregulation of genes involved in cell death, cell motility, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, four genes with genetic variants associated with PAH were dysregulated in mouse ECs in PAH. To compare relevance across PAH models and species, we performed a detailed analysis of EC heterogeneity and response to PAH in rats and humans through whole-lung PAH scRNA-seq datasets, revealing that 51% of up-regulated mouse genes were also up-regulated in rat or human PAH. We identified promising new candidates to target endothelial dysfunction including CD74, the knockdown of which regulates EC proliferation and barrier integrity in vitro. Finally, with an in silico cell ordering approach, we identified zonation-dependent changes across the arteriovenous axis in mouse PAH and showed upregulation of the Serine/threonine-protein kinase Sgk1 at the junction between the macro- and microvasculature.\\ This study uncovers PAH-induced EC transcriptomic changes at a high resolution, revealing novel targets for potential therapeutic candidate development.}

Pathway enrichment revealed associations with lipid homeostasis, glucuronidation, phospholipid metabolism, and gastrointestinal motility. Anoctamin 1 (ANO1) and transmembrane Protein 147 (TMEM147), both in novel, replicated loci, are expressed in the gallbladder and gastrointestinal tract. Both regulate gastrointestinal motility. The gallstone risk allele rs7599-A leads to suppression of hepatic TMEM147 expression, suggesting that the protein protects against gallstone formation. The highest decile of the PRS demonstrated a 6-fold increased odds of gallstones compared with the lowest decile. The PRS was strongly associated with increased body mass index, serum liver enzymes, and C-reactive protein concentrations, and decreased lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations.\\ This GWAS demonstrates the polygenic nature of gallstone risk and identifies 46 novel susceptibility loci. We implicate genes influencing gastrointestinal motility in the pathogenesis of gallstones.}

   Abstract={Fibrosis contributes to ~45% of deaths in western countries. In chronic liver disease, fibrosis is a major factor determining outcomes, but efficient antifibrotic therapies are lacking. Although platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-β constitute key fibrogenic mediators, they do not account for the well-established link between cell death and fibrosis in the liver. Here, we hypothesized that damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) may link epithelial cell death to fibrogenesis in the injured liver. DAMP receptor screening identified purinergic receptor P2Y14 among several candidates as highly enriched in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main fibrogenic cell type of the liver. Conversely, P2Y14 ligands uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose and UDP-galactose were enriched in hepatocytes and were released upon different modes of cell death. Accordingly, ligand-receptor interaction analysis that combined proteomic and single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed P2Y14 ligands and P2Y14 receptor as a link between dying cells and HSCs, respectively. Treatment with P2Y14 ligands or coculture with dying hepatocytes promoted HSC activation in a P2Y14-dependent manner. P2Y14 ligands activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling in HSCs, resulting in ERK-dependent HSC activation. Global and HSC-selective P2Y14 deficiency attenuated liver fibrosis in multiple mouse models of liver injury. Functional expression of P2Y14 was confirmed in healthy and diseased human liver and human HSCs. In conclusion, P2Y14 ligands and their receptor constitute a profibrogenic DAMP pathway that directly links cell death to fibrogenesis.}

   Abstract={Coronary vasculature formation is a critical event during cardiac development, essential for heart function throughout perinatal and adult life. However, current understanding of coronary vascular development has largely been derived from transgenic mouse models. The aim of this study was to characterise the transcriptome of the human fetal cardiac endothelium using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to provide critical new insights into the cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics that underpin endothelial specification within the vasculature of the developing heart.\\ We acquired scRNA-seq data of over 10,000 fetal cardiac endothelial cells (EC), revealing divergent EC subtypes including endocardial, capillary, venous, arterial, and lymphatic populations. Gene regulatory network analyses predicted roles for SMAD1 and MECOM in determining the identity of capillary and arterial populations, respectively. Trajectory inference analysis suggested an endocardial contribution to the coronary vasculature and subsequent arterialisation of capillary endothelium accompanied by increasing MECOM expression. Comparative analysis of equivalent data from murine cardiac development demonstrated that transcriptional signatures defining endothelial subpopulations are largely conserved between human and mouse. Comprehensive characterisation of the transcriptional response to MECOM knockdown in human embryonic stem cell-derived EC (hESC-EC) demonstrated an increase in the expression of non-arterial markers, including those enriched in venous EC.\\ scRNA-seq of the human fetal cardiac endothelium identified distinct EC populations. A predicted endocardial contribution to the developing coronary vasculature was identified, as well as subsequent arterial specification of capillary EC. Loss of MECOM in hESC-EC increased expression of non-arterial markers, suggesting a role in maintaining arterial EC identity.\\ Endogenous blood vessel formation in the adult heart following myocardial infarction is insufficient to support adequate survival of the remaining myocardium, often ultimately leading to heart failure. Improved understanding of the mechanisms regulating human coronary vessel formation is required to inform therapeutic strategies to reactivate developmental pathways promoting therapeutic angiogenesis in patients. We applied scRNA-seq to map the transcriptome of the endothelium of the developing human heart. We identified novel transcriptional signatures underlying the cellular heterogeneity and dynamic changes occurring within the developing cardiac endothelium. This included identifying and validating MECOM as a novel regulator of arterial EC identity which may serve as a target for therapeutic neovascularization.}

   Abstract={Current computational workflows for comparative analyses of single-cell datasets typically use discrete clusters as input when testing for differential abundance among experimental conditions. However, clusters do not always provide the appropriate resolution and cannot capture continuous trajectories. Here we present Milo, a scalable statistical framework that performs differential abundance testing by assigning cells to partially overlapping neighborhoods on a k-nearest neighbor graph. Using simulations and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we show that Milo can identify perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters, that it maintains false discovery rate control across batch effects and that it outperforms alternative differential abundance testing strategies. Milo identifies the decline of a fate-biased epithelial precursor in the aging mouse thymus and identifies perturbations to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver. As Milo is based on a cell-cell similarity structure, it might also be applicable to single-cell data other than scRNA-seq.

   Abstract={) is a missense variant within the APOE gene determining ϵ4 versus ϵ2/ϵ3 alleles. The ϵ4 allele of APOE offered protection against NAFLD (odds ratio for heterozygotes 0.84 [95% confidence interval 0.78-0.90] and homozygotes 0.64 [0.50-0.79]). Conclusion: This GWAS replicates six known NAFLD-susceptibility loci and confirms that the ϵ4 allele of APOE is associated with protection against NAFLD. The results are consistent with published GWAS using histological and radiological measures of NAFLD, confirming that NAFLD identified through diagnostic codes from consensus guidelines is a valid alternative to more invasive and costly approaches.}

   Abstract={In the liver, ductal cells rarely proliferate during homeostasis but do so transiently after tissue injury. These cells can be expanded as organoids that recapitulate several of the cell-autonomous mechanisms of regeneration but lack the stromal interactions of the native tissue. Here, using organoid co-cultures that recapitulate the ductal-to-mesenchymal cell architecture of the portal tract, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of mouse periportal mesenchymal cells exerts dual control on proliferation of the epithelium. Ductal cell proliferation is either induced and sustained or, conversely, completely abolished, depending on the number of direct mesenchymal cell contacts, through a mechanism mediated, at least in part, by Notch signaling. Our findings expand the concept of the cellular niche in epithelial tissues, whereby not only soluble factors but also cell-cell contacts are the key regulatory cues involved in the control of cellular behaviors, suggesting a critical role for cell-cell contacts during regeneration.}

   Abstract={Central nervous system injury re-initiates neurogenesis in anamniotes (amphibians and fishes), but not in mammals. Activation of the innate immune system promotes regenerative neurogenesis, but it is fundamentally unknown whether this is indirect through the activation of known developmental signaling pathways or whether immune cells directly signal to progenitor cells using mechanisms that are unique to regeneration. Using single-cell RNA-seq of progenitor cells and macrophages, as well as cell-type-specific manipulations, we provide evidence for a direct signaling axis from specific lesion-activated macrophages to spinal progenitor cells to promote regenerative neurogenesis in zebrafish. Mechanistically, TNFa from pro-regenerative macrophages induces Tnfrsf1a-mediated AP-1 activity in progenitors to increase regeneration-promoting expression of hdac1 and neurogenesis. This establishes the principle that macrophages directly communicate to spinal progenitor cells via non-developmental signals after injury, providing potential targets for future interventions in the regeneration-deficient spinal cord of mammals.}

Identifying the molecular markers that actively maintain the integrity of the podocyte will enable a greater understanding of the changes that lead to damage.\\ We generated transgenic zebrafish, expressing fluorescent reporters driven by the podocin promoter, for the visualization and isolation of podocytes. We have conducted single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on isolated podocytes from a zebrafish reporter line.\\ We demonstrated that the LifeAct-TagRFP-T fluorescent reporter faithfully replicated podocin expression in vivo. We were also able to show spontaneous GCaMP6s fluorescence using light sheet (single plane illumination) microscopy. We identified many podocyte transcripts, encoding proteins related to calcium-binding and actin filament assembly, in common with those expressed in human and mouse mature podocytes.\\ We describe the establishment of novel transgenic zebrafish and their use to identify and isolate podocyte cells for the preparation of a scRNA-seq library from normal podocytes. The scRNA-seq data identifies distinct populations of cells and potential gene switching between clusters. These data provide a foundation for future comparative studies and for exploiting the zebrafish as a model for kidney development, disease, injury and repair.}

   Abstract={The endometrium is a dynamic tissue that exhibits remarkable resilience to repeated episodes of differentiation, breakdown, regeneration, and remodeling. Endometrial physiology relies on a complex interplay between the stromal and epithelial compartments with the former containing a mixture of fibroblasts, vascular, and immune cells. There is evidence for rare populations of putative mesenchymal progenitor cells located in the perivascular niche of human endometrium, but the existence of an equivalent cell population in mouse is unclear. We used the Pdgfrb-BAC-eGFP transgenic reporter mouse in combination with bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to redefine the endometrial mesenchyme. In contrast to previous reports we show that CD146 is expressed in both PDGFRβ + perivascular cells and CD31 + endothelial cells. Bulk RNAseq revealed cells in the perivascular niche which express the high levels of Pdgfrb as well as genes previously identified in pericytes and/or vascular smooth muscle cells (Acta2, Myh11, Olfr78, Cspg4, Rgs4, Rgs5, Kcnj8, and Abcc9). scRNA-seq identified five subpopulations of cells including closely related pericytes/vascular smooth muscle cells and three subpopulations of fibroblasts. All three fibroblast populations were PDGFRα+/CD34 + but were distinct in their expression of Ngfr/Spon2/Angptl7 (F1), Cxcl14/Smoc2/Rgs2 (F2), and Clec3b/Col14a1/Mmp3 (F3), with potential functions in the regulation of immune responses, response to wounding, and organization of extracellular matrix, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the spatial distribution of these populations revealing F1/NGFR + cells in most abundance beside epithelial cells. We provide the first definitive analysis of mesenchymal cells in the adult mouse endometrium identifying five subpopulations providing a platform for comparisons between mesenchymal cells in endometrium and other adult tissues which are prone to fibrosis.}

As our knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving hepatic regeneration deepens, the key role of the mesenchymal compartment during the regenerative response has been increasingly appreciated. Single-cell genomics approaches have recently uncovered both spatial and functional zonation of the hepatic mesenchyme in homeostasis and following liver injury. Here we discuss how the use of preclinical models, from in vivo mouse models to organoid-based systems, are helping to shape our understanding of the role of the mesenchyme during liver regeneration, and how these approaches should facilitate the precise identification of highly targeted, pro-regenerative therapies for patients with liver disease.}

   Abstract={Renal fibrosis is a common end point for kidney injury and many chronic kidney diseases. Fibrogenesis depends on the sustained activation of myofibroblasts, which deposit the extracellular matrix that causes progressive scarring and organ failure. Here, we showed that the transcription factor SOX9 was associated with kidney fibrosis in humans and required for experimentally induced kidney fibrosis in mice. From genome-wide analysis, we identified Neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) as acting downstream of SOX9 in kidney fibrosis. NAV3 increased in abundance and colocalized with SOX9 after renal injury in mice, and both SOX9 and NAV3 were present in diseased human kidneys. In an in vitro model of renal pericyte transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, we demonstrated that NAV3 was required for multiple aspects of fibrogenesis, including actin polymerization linked to cell migration and sustained activation of the mechanosensitive transcription factor YAP1. In summary, our work identifies a SOX9-NAV3-YAP1 axis involved in the progression of kidney fibrosis and points to NAV3 as a potential target for pharmacological intervention.}

Organ microRNA expression was measured in health and following paracetamol toxicity. The functional consequence of hepatic microRNA transfer was determined by measuring the expression and activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 (target of the hepatocellular miR-122), and by measuring the effect of serum extracellular vesicles (ECVs) on proximal tubular cell injury. In humans with liver injury we measured microRNA expression in urinary ECVs. A murine model of myocardial infarction was used as a non-hepatic model of microRNA release.\\ Dicer-CKO mice demonstrated a decrease in kidney miR-122 in the absence of other microRNA changes. During hepatotoxicity, miR-122 increased in kidney tubular cells; this was abolished in Dicer-CKO mice. Depletion of hepatocyte microRNA increased kidney cytochrome P450 2E1 expression and activity. Serum ECVs from mice with hepatotoxicity increased proximal tubular cell miR-122 and prevented cisplatin toxicity. miR-122 increased in urinary ECVs during human hepatotoxicity. Transfer of microRNA was not restricted to liver injury -miR-499 was released following cardiac injury and correlated with an increase in the kidney.\\ Physiological transfer of functional microRNA to the kidney is increased by liver injury and this signalling represents a new paradigm for understanding the relationship between liver injury and renal function.\\ Kidney Research UK, Medical Research Scotland, Medical Research Council.}

   Abstract={Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) develop in distinct waves at various anatomical sites during embryonic development. The in vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) recapitulates some of these processes; however, it has proven difficult to generate functional hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To define the dynamics and heterogeneity of HSPCs that can be generated in vitro from hPSCs, we explored single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in combination with single-cell protein expression analysis. Bioinformatics analyses and functional validation defined the transcriptomes of naïve progenitors and erythroid-, megakaryocyte-, and leukocyte-committed progenitors, and we identified CD44, CD326, ICAM2/CD9, and CD18, respectively, as markers of these progenitors. Using an artificial neural network that we trained on scRNAseq derived from human fetal liver, we identified a wide range of hPSC-derived HSPCs phenotypes, including a small group classified as HSCs. This transient HSC-like population decreased as differentiation proceeded, and was completely missing in the data set that had been generated using cells selected on the basis of CD43 expression. By comparing the single-cell transcriptome of in vitro-generated HSC-like cells with those generated within the fetal liver, we identified transcription factors and molecular pathways that can be explored in the future to improve the in vitro production of HSCs.}

It has long been thought to be relentlessly progressive and irreversible, but both preclinical models and clinical trials in various organ systems have shown that fibrosis is a highly dynamic process. This has clear implications for therapeutic interventions that are designed to capitalize on this inherent plasticity. However, despite substantial progress in our understanding of the pathobiology of fibrosis, a translational gap remains between the identification of putative antifibrotic targets and conversion of this knowledge into effective treatments in humans.

   Abstract={Transcriptome analysis enables the study of gene expression in human tissues and is a valuable tool to characterise liver function and gene expression dynamics during liver disease, as well as to identify prognostic markers or signatures, and to facilitate discovery of new therapeutic targets. In contrast to whole tissue RNA sequencing analysis, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics enables the study of transcriptional activity at the single cell or spatial level. ScRNA-seq has paved the way for the discovery of previously unknown cell types and subtypes in normal and diseased liver, facilitating the study of rare cells (such as liver progenitor cells) and the functional roles of non-parenchymal cells in chronic liver disease and cancer. By adding spatial information to scRNA-seq data, spatial transcriptomics has transformed our understanding of tissue functional organisation and cell-to-cell interactions in situ. These approaches have recently been applied to investigate liver regeneration, organisation and function of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, and to profile the single cell landscape of chronic liver diseases and cancer. Herein, we review the principles and technologies behind scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic approaches, highlighting the recent discoveries and novel insights these methodologies have yielded in both liver physiology and disease biology.}

   Abstract={Liver disease is a major global health-care problem, affecting an estimated 844 million people worldwide. Despite this substantial burden, therapeutic options for liver disease remain limited, in part owing to a paucity of detailed analyses defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive these conditions in humans. Single-cell transcriptomic technologies are transforming our understanding of cellular diversity and function in health and disease. In this Review, we discuss how these technologies have been applied in hepatology, advancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and providing novel insights into fundamental liver biology such as the metabolic zonation of hepatocytes, endothelial cells and hepatic stellate cells, and the cellular mechanisms underpinning liver regeneration. Application of these methodologies is also uncovering critical pathophysiological changes driving disease states such as hepatic fibrosis, where distinct populations of macrophages, endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells reside within a spatially distinct fibrotic niche and interact to promote scar formation. In addition, single-cell approaches are starting to dissect key cellular and molecular functions in liver cancer. In the near future, new techniques such as spatial transcriptomics and multiomic approaches will further deepen our understanding of disease pathogenesis, enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets for patients across the spectrum of liver diseases.}

   Abstract={The overexpression of the protein tyrosine kinase, Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), in endothelial cells has implicated its requirement in angiogenesis and tumour growth, but how pericyte FAK regulates tumour angiogenesis is unknown. We show that pericyte FAK regulates tumour growth and angiogenesis in multiple mouse models of melanoma, lung carcinoma and pancreatic B-cell insulinoma and provide evidence that loss of pericyte FAK enhances Gas6-stimulated phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, Axl with an upregulation of Cyr61, driving enhanced tumour growth. We further show that pericyte derived Cyr61 instructs tumour cells to elevate expression of the proangiogenic/protumourigenic transmembrane receptor Tissue Factor. Finally, in human melanoma we show that when 50% or more tumour blood vessels are pericyte-FAK negative, melanoma patients are stratified into those with increased tumour size, enhanced blood vessel density and metastasis. Overall our data uncover a previously unknown mechanism of tumour growth by pericytes that is controlled by pericyte FAK.}

   Abstract={Enhanced blood vessel (BV) formation is thought to drive tumor growth through elevated nutrient delivery. However, this observation has overlooked potential roles for mural cells in directly affecting tumor growth independent of BV function. Here we provide clinical data correlating high percentages of mural-β3-integrin-negative tumor BVs with increased tumor sizes but no effect on BV numbers. Mural-β3-integrin loss also enhances tumor growth in implanted and autochthonous mouse tumor models with no detectable effects on BV numbers or function. At a molecular level, mural-cell β3-integrin loss enhances signaling via FAK-p-HGFR-p-Akt-p-p65, driving CXCL1, CCL2, and TIMP-1 production. In particular, mural-cell-derived CCL2 stimulates tumor cell MEK1-ERK1/2-ROCK2-dependent signaling and enhances tumor cell survival and tumor growth. Overall, our data indicate that mural cells can control tumor growth via paracrine signals regulated by β3-integrin, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism of cancer growth control.}

   Abstract={Collagen-producing cells maintain the complex architecture of the lung and drive pathologic scarring in pulmonary fibrosis. Here we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify all collagen-producing cells in normal and fibrotic lungs. We characterize multiple collagen-producing subpopulations with distinct anatomical localizations in different compartments of murine lungs. One subpopulation, characterized by expression of Cthrc1 (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1), emerges in fibrotic lungs and expresses the highest levels of collagens. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of human lungs, including those from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and scleroderma patients, demonstrate similar heterogeneity and CTHRC1-expressing fibroblasts present uniquely in fibrotic lungs. Immunostaining and in situ hybridization show that these cells are concentrated within fibroblastic foci. We purify collagen-producing subpopulations and find disease-relevant phenotypes of Cthrc1-expressing fibroblasts in in vitro and adoptive transfer experiments. Our atlas of collagen-producing cells provides a roadmap for studying the roles of these unique populations in homeostasis and pathologic fibrosis.}

   Abstract={Pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell products possess therapeutic potential in ischaemic vascular disease. However, the factors that drive endothelial differentiation from pluripotency and cellular specification are largely unknown. The aims of this study were to use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the transcriptional landscape and cellular dynamics of directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells (hESC-EC) and to compare these cells to mature endothelial cells from diverse vascular beds.\\ A highly efficient directed 8-day differentiation protocol was used to generate a hESC-derived endothelial cell product (hESC-ECP), in which 66% of cells co-expressed CD31 and CD144. We observed largely homogeneous hESC and mesodermal populations at Days 0 and 4, respectively, followed by a rapid emergence of distinct endothelial and mesenchymal populations. Pseudotime trajectory identified transcriptional signatures of endothelial commitment and maturation during the differentiation process. Concordance in transcriptional signatures was verified by scRNA-seq analysis using both a second hESC line RC11, and an alternative hESC-EC differentiation protocol. In total, 105 727 cells were subjected to scRNA-seq analysis. Global transcriptional comparison revealed a transcriptional architecture of hESC-EC that differs from freshly isolated and cultured human endothelial cells and from organ-specific endothelial cells.\\ A transcriptional bifurcation into endothelial and mesenchymal lineages was identified, as well as novel transcriptional signatures underpinning commitment and maturation. The transcriptional architecture of hESC-ECP was distinct from mature and foetal human EC.}

   Abstract={Pulmonary inflammatory responses lie under circadian control; however, the importance of circadian mechanisms in the underlying fibrotic phenotype is not understood. Here, we identify a striking change to these mechanisms resulting in a gain of amplitude and lack of synchrony within pulmonary fibrotic tissue. These changes result from an infiltration of mesenchymal cells, an important cell type in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Mutation of the core clock protein REVERBα in these cells exacerbated the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, whereas mutation of REVERBα in club or myeloid cells had no effect on the bleomycin phenotype. Knockdown of REVERBα revealed regulation of the little-understood transcription factor TBPL1. Both REVERBα and TBPL1 altered integrinβ1 focal-adhesion formation, resulting in increased myofibroblast activation. The translational importance of our findings was established through analysis of 2 human cohorts. In the UK Biobank, circadian strain markers (sleep length, chronotype, and shift work) are associated with pulmonary fibrosis, making them risk factors. In a separate cohort, REVERBα expression was increased in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue. Pharmacological targeting of REVERBα inhibited myofibroblast activation in IPF fibroblasts and collagen secretion in organotypic cultures from IPF patients, thus suggesting that targeting of REVERBα could be a viable therapeutic approach.}

Despite major advances in our understanding of the mechanisms regulating fibrosis, treatment options for patients with fibrosis remain very limited.

In this review, we will discuss how single-cell transcriptomics is driving this step change in our understanding of fibrotic disease pathogenesis, and how these cutting-edge approaches should accelerate the precise identification of novel, relevant and potentially druggable therapeutic targets to treat patients with fibrosis.}

  abstract={Iterative liver injury results in progressive fibrosis disrupting hepatic architecture, regeneration potential, and liver function. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are a major source of pathological matrix during fibrosis and are thought to be a functionally homogeneous population. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to deconvolve the hepatic mesenchyme in healthy and fibrotic mouse liver, revealing spatial zonation of HSCs across the hepatic lobule. Furthermore, we show that HSCs partition into topographically diametric lobule regions, designated portal vein-associated HSCs (PaHSCs) and central vein-associated HSCs (CaHSCs). Importantly we uncover functional zonation, identifying CaHSCs as the dominant pathogenic collagen-producing cells in a mouse model of centrilobular fibrosis. Finally, we identify LPAR1 as a therapeutic target on collagen-producing CaHSCs, demonstrating that blockade of LPAR1 inhibits liver fibrosis in a rodent NASH model. Taken together, our work illustrates the power of single-cell transcriptomics to resolve the key collagen-producing cells driving liver fibrosis with high precision.},

  abstract={Liver cirrhosis is a major cause of death worldwide and is characterized by extensive fibrosis. There are currently no effective antifibrotic therapies available. To obtain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis and enable the discovery of therapeutic targets, here we profile the transcriptomes of more than 100,000 single human cells, yielding molecular definitions for non-parenchymal cell types that are found in healthy and cirrhotic human liver. We identify a scar-associated TREM2+CD9+ subpopulation of macrophages, which expands in liver fibrosis, differentiates from circulating monocytes and is pro-fibrogenic. We also define ACKR1+ and PLVAP+ endothelial cells that expand in cirrhosis, are topographically restricted to the fibrotic niche and enhance the transmigration of leucocytes. Multi-lineage modelling of ligand and receptor interactions between the scar-associated macrophages, endothelial cells and PDGFRα+ collagen-producing mesenchymal cells reveals intra-scar activity of several pro-fibrogenic pathways including TNFRSF12A, PDGFR and NOTCH signalling. Our work dissects unanticipated aspects of the cellular and molecular basis of human organ fibrosis at a single-cell level, and provides a conceptual framework for the discovery of rational therapeutic targets in liver cirrhosis.},

   Abstract={The exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP 1 and 2 (Epac1 and Epac2) are expressed in a cell specific manner in the liver, but their biological functions in this tissue are poorly understood. The current study was undertaken to begin to determine the potential roles of Epac1 and Epac2 in liver physiology and disease. Male C57BL/6J mice in which expression of Epac1 and/or Epac2 are deleted, were subjected to partial hepatectomy and the regenerating liver was analyzed with regard to lipid accumulation, cell replication and protein expression. In response to partial hepatectomy, deletion of Epac1 and/or Epac2 led to increased hepatocyte proliferation 36 h post surgery, and the transient steatosis observed in wild type mice was virtually absent in mice lacking both Epac1 and Epac2. The expression of the protein cytochrome P4504a14, which is implicated in hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, was substantially reduced upon deletion of Epac1/2, while a number of factors involved in lipid metabolism were significantly decreased. Moreover, the number of Küpffer cells was affected, and Epac2 expression was increased in the liver of wild type mice in response to partial hepatectomy, further supporting a role for these proteins in liver function. This study establishes hepatic phenotypic abnormalities in mice deleted for Epac1/2 for the first time, and introduces Epac1/2 as regulators of hepatocyte proliferation and lipid accumulation in the regenerative process.}

   Abstract={A better understanding of the pathways that regulate regeneration of the coronary vasculature is of fundamental importance for the advancement of strategies to treat patients with heart disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the origin and clonal dynamics of endothelial cells (ECs) associated with neovascularization in the adult mouse heart following myocardial infarction (MI). Furthermore, we sought to define murine cardiac endothelial heterogeneity and to characterize the transcriptional profiles of pro-angiogenic resident ECs in the adult mouse heart, at single-cell resolution.\\ An EC-specific multispectral lineage-tracing mouse (Pdgfb-iCreERT2-R26R-Brainbow2.1) was used to demonstrate that structural integrity of adult cardiac endothelium following MI was maintained through clonal proliferation by resident ECs in the infarct border region, without significant contributions from bone marrow cells or endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Ten transcriptionally discrete heterogeneous EC states, as well as the pathways through which each endothelial state is likely to enhance neovasculogenesis and tissue regeneration following ischaemic injury were defined. Plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (Plvap) was selected for further study, which showed an endothelial-specific and increased expression in both the ischaemic mouse and human heart, and played a direct role in regulating human endothelial proliferation in vitro.\\ We present a single-cell gene expression atlas of cardiac specific resident ECs, and the transcriptional hierarchy underpinning endogenous vascular repair following MI. These data provide a rich resource that could assist in the development of new therapeutic interventions to augment endogenous myocardial perfusion and enhance regeneration in the injured heart.}

Macrophages are professional phagocytes necessary for liver inflammation, fibrosis, and resolution, switching their phenotype from proinflammatory to restorative. Using sterile liver injury models, we show that the STAT3-IL-10-IL-6 axis is a positive regulator of macrophage efferocytosis, survival, and phenotypic conversion, directly linking debris engulfment to tissue repair.}

Some mice were irradiated and given transplants of bone marrow cells from C57BL6 mice, with or without the S1P antagonist FTY720; we then studied HSC mobilization and localization. Migration of HSC lines was quantified in Transwell assays. Levels of S1P in liver, bone marrow, and lymph fluid were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemical quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sphingosine kinase activity assays. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses of the expression of sphingosine kinase 1 and 2, sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1, and sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 1 in normal human liver and cirrhotic liver from patients with alcohol-related liver disease (n = 6).\\ .05), and further reductions in fibrosis.\\ In studies of mice with chronic liver injury, we showed the antifibrotic effects of repeated infusions of purified HSCs. We found that HSCs promote recruitment of endogenous macrophages and neutrophils. Strategies to reduce SIP signaling and increase retention of HSCs in the liver could increase their antifibrotic activities and be developed for treatment of patients with liver fibrosis.}

   Abstract={Schistosomiasis affects approximately 240 million people in the world. Schistosoma mansoni eggs in the liver induce periportal fibrosis and hepatic failure driven by monocyte recruitment and macrophage activation, resulting in robust Th2 response. Here, we suggested a possible involvement of Galectin-3 (Gal-3), histone deacetylases (HDACs), and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling with macrophage activation during Th1/Th2 immune responses, fibrogranuloma reaction, and tissue repair during schistosomiasis. Gal-3 is highly expressed by liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) around Schistosoma eggs. HDACs and Hh regulate macrophage polarization and hepatic stellate cell activation during schistosomiasis-associated fibrogenesis. Previously, we demonstrated an abnormal extracellular matrix distribution in the liver that correlated with atypical monocyte-macrophage differentiation in S. mansoni-infected, Gal-3-deficient (Lgals3-/-) mice. New findings explored in this review focus on the chronic phase, when wild-type (Lgals3+/+) and Lgals3-/- mice were analyzed 90 days after cercariae infection. In Lgals3-/- infected mice, there was significant inflammatory infiltration with myeloid cells associated with egg destruction (hematoxylin and eosin staining), phagocytes (specifically Kupffer cells), numerically reduced and diffuse matrix extracellular deposition in fibrotic areas (Gomori trichrome staining), and severe disorganization of collagen fibers surrounding the S. mansoni eggs (reticulin staining). Granuloma-derived stromal cells (GR cells) of Lgals3-/- infected mice expressed lower levels of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and eotaxin and higher levels of IL-4 than Lgals3+/+ mice (real-time PCR). The relevant participation of macrophages in these events led us to suggest distinct mechanisms of activation that culminate in defective fibrosis in the liver of Lgals3-/- infected mice. These aspects were discussed in this review, as well as the possible interference between Gal-3, HDACs, and Hh signaling during progressive liver fibrosis in S. mansoni-infected mice. Further studies focused on macrophage roles could elucidate these questions and clear the potential utility of these molecules as antifibrotic targets.}

   Abstract={Molecular mechanisms regulating liver repair following cholestatic injury remain largely unknown. We have combined a mouse model of acute cholestatic liver injury, partial bile duct ligation (pBDL), with a novel longitudinal bioimaging methodology to quantify transcription factor activity during hepatic injury and repair. We administered lentiviral transcription factor activated luciferase/eGFP reporter (TFAR) cassettes to neonatal mice enabling longitudinal TFAR profiling by continued bioimaging throughout the lives of the animals and following pBDL in adulthood. Neonatal intravascular injection of VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus resulted in almost exclusive transduction of hepatocytes allowing analysis of hepatocyte-specific transcription factor activity. We recorded acute but transient responses with NF-κB and Smad2/3 TFAR whilst our Notch reporter was repressed over the 40 days of evaluation post-pBDL. The bipotent hepatic progenitor cell line, HepaRG, can be directed to differentiate into hepatocytes and biliary epithelia. We found that forced expression of the Notch inhibitor NUMB in HepaRG resulted in enhanced hepatocyte differentiation and proliferation whereas over-expressing the Notch agonist JAG1 resulted in biliary epithelial differentiation. In conclusion, our data demonstrates that hepatocytes rapidly upregulate NF-κB and Smad2/3 activity, whilst repressing Notch signalling. This transcriptional response to cholestatic liver injury likely promotes partial de-differentiation to allow pro-regenerative proliferation of hepatocytes.}

   Abstract={Dysfunction of cell-cell tight junction (TJ) adhesions is a major feature in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Liver TJs preserve cellular polarity by delimiting functional bile-canalicular structures, forming the blood-biliary barrier. In acetaminophen-hepatotoxicity, the mechanism by which tissue cohesion and polarity are affected remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that acetaminophen, even at low-dose, disrupts the integrity of TJ and cell-matrix adhesions, with indicators of cellular stress with liver injury in the human hepatic HepaRG cell line, and primary hepatocytes. In mouse liver, at human-equivalence (therapeutic) doses, dose-dependent loss of intercellular hepatic TJ-associated ZO-1 protein expression was evident with progressive clinical signs of liver injury. Temporal, dose-dependent and specific disruption of the TJ-associated ZO-1 and cytoskeletal-F-actin proteins, correlated with modulation of hepatic ultrastructure. Real-time impedance biosensing verified in vitro early, dose-dependent quantitative decreases in TJ and cell-substrate adhesions. Whereas treatment with NAPQI, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen, or the PKCα-activator and TJ-disruptor phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, similarly reduced TJ integrity, which may implicate oxidative stress and the PKC pathway in TJ destabilization. These findings are relevant to the clinical presentation of acetaminophen-hepatotoxicity and may inform future mechanistic studies to identify specific molecular targets and pathways that may be altered in acetaminophen-induced hepatic depolarization.}

   Abstract={Chronic liver disease prevalence is increasing globally. Iterative liver damage, secondary to any cause of liver injury, results in progressive fibrosis, disrupted hepatic architecture, and aberrant regeneration, which are defining characteristics of liver cirrhosis. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for end-stage liver disease; however, demand greatly outweighs donor organ supply, and in many parts of the world liver transplantation is unavailable. Hence, effective antifibrotic therapies are urgently required. In the past decade, rapid progress has been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of liver fibrosis and a large number of potential cellular and molecular antifibrotic targets have been identified. This has led to numerous clinical trials of antifibrotic agents in patients with chronic liver disease. However, none of these have resulted in a robust and reproducible effect on fibrosis. It is therefore imperative that the ongoing translational challenges are addressed, to convert scientific discoveries into potent antifibrotics and enable bridging of the translational gap between putative therapeutic targets and effective treatments for patients with chronic liver disease.}

   Abstract={Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy demands the attention of clinicians and scientists because of its potential in clinical fields that are bereft of medical options, but also because of the controversies that underlie its mode of action. MSCs are potent immune modulators, yet their biologic activity may not be innate, requiring licensing by their microenvironment. This property has prompted researchers to explore unique ways in which MSCs may be able to exert distinct biologic effects in different pathologic settings. More than 400 clinical trials have investigated the therapeutic capacity of MSCs in different pathologies, including liver disease. Along with their anti-inflammatory action, there are data to suggest that MSCs may exert direct antifibrotic effects, although enthusiasm for their use in patients has been tempered by concerns of a possible profibrotic role of endogenous MSCs in response to injury. There is a significant need for antifibrotic therapy to combat the increasing burden of patients with cirrhosis, and a concerted effort is required to determine the mechanisms by which MSCs modulate the liver's response to injury, both endogenously and after adoptive transfer. This review critically appraises the preclinical published data with regard to the capacity of MSCs to influence fibrotic response to liver injury and will explore the potential mechanisms that underpin the reported beneficial effects of MSC therapy in the context of liver injury and fibrosis.-Haldar, D., Henderson, N.

   Abstract={Chronic tissue injury with fibrosis results in the disruption of tissue architecture, organ dysfunction and eventual organ failure. Therefore, the development of effective anti-fibrotic therapies is urgently required. During fibrogenesis, complex interplay occurs between cellular and extracellular matrix components of the wound healing response. Integrins, a family of transmembrane cell adhesion molecules, play a key role in mediating intercellular and cell-matrix interactions. Thus, integrins provide a major node of communication between the extracellular matrix, inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and parenchymal cells and, as such, are intimately involved in the initiation, maintenance and resolution of tissue fibrosis. Modulation of members of the αv integrin family has exhibited profound effects on fibrosis in multiple organs and disease states. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of the mechanisms of αv-integrin-mediated regulation of fibrogenesis and show that the therapeutic targeting of specific αv integrins represents a promising avenue to treat patients with a broad range of fibrotic diseases.}

   Abstract={Fibrosis due to extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion from myofibroblasts complicates many chronic liver diseases causing scarring and organ failure. Integrin-dependent interaction with scar ECM promotes pro-fibrotic features. However, the pathological intracellular mechanism in liver myofibroblasts is not completely understood, and further insight could enable therapeutic efforts to reverse fibrosis. Here, we show that integrin beta-1, capable of binding integrin alpha-11, regulates the pro-fibrotic phenotype of myofibroblasts. Integrin beta-1 expression is upregulated in pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts in vivo and is required in vitro for production of fibrotic ECM components, myofibroblast proliferation, migration and contraction. Serine/threonine-protein kinase proteins, also known as P21-activated kinase (PAK), and the mechanosensitive factor, Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP-1) are core mediators of pro-fibrotic integrin beta-1 signalling, with YAP-1 capable of perpetuating integrin beta-1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of either pathway in vivo attenuates liver fibrosis. PAK protein inhibition, in particular, markedly inactivates the pro-fibrotic myofibroblast phenotype, limits scarring from different hepatic insults and represents a new tractable therapeutic target for treating liver fibrosis.}

Hepatic fibrosis was induced in CD248(-/-) and wild-type controls with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment.\\ Expression of CD248 was seen in normal liver of humans and mice but was significantly increased in liver injury using both immunostaining and gene expression assays. CD248 was co-expressed with a range of fibroblast/HSC markers including desmin, vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in murine and human liver sections. CD248 expression was restricted to isolated primary murine and human HSC. Collagen deposition and α-SMA expression, but not inflammation and neoangiogenesis, was reduced in CD248(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice after CCl4 treatment. Isolated HSC from wild-type and CD248(-/-) mice expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFR-α) and PDGFR-β at similar levels. As expected, PDGF-BB stimulation induced proliferation of wild-type HSC, whereas CD248(-/-) HSC did not demonstrate a proliferative response to PDGF-BB. Abrogated PDGF signalling in CD248(-/-) HSC was confirmed by significantly reduced c-fos expression in CD248(-/-) HSC compared with wild-type HSC.\\ Our data show that deletion of CD248 reduces susceptibility to liver fibrosis via an effect on PDGF signalling, making it an attractive clinical target for the treatment of liver injury.}

   Abstract={Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and is increasing in incidence. Currently, our therapeutic repertoire for the treatment of HCC is severely limited, and therefore effective new therapies are urgently required. Recently, there has been increasing interest focusing on the cellular and molecular interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment. HCC represents a unique opportunity to study the relationship between a diseased stroma and promotion of carcinogenesis, as 90% of HCCs arise in a cirrhotic liver. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the major source of extracellular proteins during fibrogenesis, and may directly, or via secreted products, contribute to tumour initiation and progression. In this review we explore the complex cellular and molecular interplay between HSC biology and hepatocarcinogenesis. We focus on the molecular mechanisms by which HSC modulate HCC growth, immune cell evasion and angiogenesis. This is followed by a discussion of recent progress in the field in understanding the mechanistic crosstalk between HSC and HCC, and the pathways that are potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, we summarise the exciting recent developments in strategies to target HSC specifically, and novel techniques to deliver pharmaceutical agents directly to HSC, potentially allowing tailored, cell-specific therapy for HCC.}

   Abstract={Following chronic liver injury or when hepatocyte proliferation is impaired, ductular reactions containing hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) appear in the periportal regions and can regenerate the liver parenchyma. HPCs exist in a niche composed of myofibroblasts, macrophages and laminin matrix. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a β-galactoside-binding lectin that binds to laminin and is expressed in injured liver in mice and humans.\\ We examined the role of Gal-3 in HPC activation. HPC activation was studied following dietary induced hepatocellular (choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet) and biliary (3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine supplemented diet) injury in wild type and Gal-3(-/-) mice.\\ HPC proliferation was significantly reduced in Gal-3(-/-) mice. Gal-3(-/-) mice failed to form a HPC niche, with reduced laminin formation. HPCs isolated from wild type mice secrete Gal-3 which enhanced adhesion and proliferation of HPCs on laminin in an undifferentiated form. These effects were attenuated in Gal3(-/-) HPCs and in wild type HPCs treated with the Gal-3 inhibitor lactose. Gal-3(-/-) HPCs in vitro showed increased hepatocyte function and prematurely upregulated both biliary and hepatocyte differentiation markers and regulated cell cycle genes leading to arrest in G0/G1.\\ We conclude that Gal-3 is required for the undifferentiated expansion of HPCs in their niche in injured liver.}

   Abstract={Myofibroblasts are the major source of extracellular matrix components that accumulate during tissue fibrosis, and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are believed to be the major source of myofibroblasts in the liver. To date, robust systems to genetically manipulate these cells have not been developed. We report that Cre under control of the promoter of Pdgfrb (Pdgfrb-Cre) inactivates loxP-flanked genes in mouse HSCs with high efficiency. We used this system to delete the gene encoding α(v) integrin subunit because various α(v)-containing integrins have been suggested as central mediators of fibrosis in multiple organs. Such depletion protected mice from carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis, whereas global loss of β₃, β₅ or β₆ integrins or conditional loss of β₈ integrins in HSCs did not. We also found that Pdgfrb-Cre effectively targeted myofibroblasts in multiple organs, and depletion of the α(v) integrin subunit using this system was protective in other models of organ fibrosis, including pulmonary and renal fibrosis. Pharmacological blockade of α(v)-containing integrins by a small molecule (CWHM 12) attenuated both liver and lung fibrosis, including in a therapeutic manner. These data identify a core pathway that regulates fibrosis and suggest that pharmacological targeting of all α(v) integrins may have clinical utility in the treatment of patients with a broad range of fibrotic diseases.}

The advent of genetic strategies that permit fate-mapping of specific cell populations through permanent and heritable expression of reporter proteins has begun to shed light on the source of the fibrogenic myofibroblast. Here we discuss recent studies in multiple organs that highlight the central role of pericytes in the origins of fibrosis.}

   Abstract={Fibrosis is a highly conserved wound healing response and represents the final common pathway of virtually all chronic inflammatory injuries. Over the past 3 decades detailed analysis of hepatic extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation using approaches incorporating human disease, experimental animal models and cell culture have highlighted the extraordinarily dynamic nature of tissue repair and remodelling in this solid organ. Furthermore emerging studies of fibrosis in other organs demonstrate that basic common mechanisms exist, suggesting that bidirectionality of the fibrotic process may not solely be the preserve of the liver. In this review we will examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern extracellular matrix degradation and fibrosis resolution, and highlight how manipulation of these processes may result in the development of effective anti-fibrotic therapies.

   Abstract={Fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, therapeutic options for tissue fibrosis are severely limited, and organ transplantation is the only effective treatment for end-stage fibrotic disease. However, demand for donor organs greatly outstrips supply, and so effective anti-fibrotic treatments are urgently required. In recent years, the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors has gained prominence as key regulators of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Fibrosis models in multiple organs have demonstrated that integrins have profound effects on the fibrotic process. There is now abundant in vivo data demonstrating critical regulatory roles for integrins expressed on different cell types during tissue fibrogenesis. In this review, we will examine the ways in which integrins regulate these processes and discuss how the manipulation of integrins using function blocking antibodies and small molecule inhibitors may have clinical utility in the treatment of patients with a broad range of fibrotic diseases.

   Abstract={The liver is a central organ for the synthesis and storage of nutrients, production of serum proteins and hormones, and breakdown of toxins and metabolites. Because the liver is susceptible to toxin- or pathogen-mediated injury, it maintains a remarkable capacity to regenerate by compensatory growth. Specifically, in response to injury, quiescent hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and undergo DNA replication to promote liver regrowth. Despite the elucidation of a number of regenerative factors, the mechanisms by which liver injury triggers hepatocyte proliferation are incompletely understood. We demonstrate here that eosinophils stimulate liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and toxin-mediated injury. Liver injury results in rapid recruitment of eosinophils, which secrete IL-4 to promote the proliferation of quiescent hepatocytes. Surprisingly, signaling via the IL-4Rα in macrophages, which have been implicated in tissue repair, is dispensable for hepatocyte proliferation and liver regrowth after injury. Instead, IL-4 exerts its proliferative actions via IL-4Rα in hepatocytes. Our findings thus provide a unique mechanism by which eosinophil-derived IL-4 stimulates hepatocyte proliferation in regenerating liver.}

   Abstract={Targeted deletion of c-jun amino terminal kinase-2 (jnk-2) upregulates the activator protein-1 transcription factor system. We hypothesized that this would lead to induction of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and confer protection from hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury.\\ Wild-type and jnk-2 -/- animals were subjected to hepatic ischemia reperfusion insults in two models: a total hepatic ischemia model involving timed Pringle maneuver, and a partial hepatic ischemia model involving selective occlusion of the portal pedicle supplying the left hepatic lobe. Optimal durations of injury were calibrated for each model. After 24 hr, animals were killed, and blood and tissues were collected for alanine aminotransferase, histologic injury scoring, and other analyses. Before total or partial hepatic ischemia reperfusion insults, some animals were subject to HO-1 inhibition with chromium mesoporphyrin IX or Kupffer cell depletion with liposomal clodronate. Bone marrow-derived monocytes were grown from hemopoietic progenitors taken from wild-type and jnk-2 -/- mice before stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and measurement of tumour necrosis factor-alpha production.\\ Jnk-2 -/- animals were protected from hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury. HO-1 expression and activity was elevated in jnk-2 -/- animals (2.2-fold; P=0.006). Most HO-1 was expressed in Kupffer cells. Inhibition of HO-1 in jnk-2 -/- animals led to the loss of protection from ischemia. Depletion of Kupffer cells using liposomal clodronate led to loss of hepatic HO-1 expression and much more severe injury in wild-type and jnk-2 -/- animals. In vitro studies of cultured macrophages demonstrated reduced tumour necrosis factor-alpha secretion after lipopolysaccharide stimulus, an effect lost after HO-1 inhibition.}

   Abstract={Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside-binding animal lectin of approximately 30 kDa and is evolutionarily highly conserved. Galectin-3 is promiscuous, its localization within the tissue micro-environment may be extracellular, cytoplasmic, or nuclear, and it has a concentration-dependent ability to be monomeric or form oligomers. These properties impart great flexibility on galectin-3 as a specific regulator of many biological systems including inflammation. For example, in acute tissue damage galectin-3 is a key component in the host defense against microbes such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, if tissue injury becomes repetitive galectin-3 also appears to be intimately involved in the transition to chronic inflammation, facilitating the walling off of tissue injury with fibrogenesis and organ scarring. Therefore galectin-3 can be viewed as a regulatory molecule acting at various stages along the continuum from acute inflammation to chronic inflammation and tissue fibrogenesis. In this review, we examine the role of galectin-3 in inflammation, and discuss the manipulation of galectin-3 expression as a potentially novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of a broad range of inflammatory diseases.}

   Abstract={Lymphocytes primed by intestinal dendritic cells (DC) express the gut-homing receptors CCR9 and alpha4beta7, which recognize CCL25 and mucosal addressin cell-adhesion molecule-1 in the intestine promoting the development of regional immunity. In mice, imprinting of CCR9 and alpha4beta7 is dependent on retinoic acid during T-cell activation. Tissue specificity is lost in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, when ectopic expression of mucosal addressin cell-adhesion molecule-1 and CCL25 in the liver promotes recruitment of CCR9+alpha4beta7+ T cells to the liver. We investigated the processes that control enterohepatic T-cell migration and whether the ability to imprint CCR9 and alpha4beta7 is restricted to intestinal DCs or can under some circumstances be acquired by hepatic DCs in diseases such as PSC.\\ Human and murine DCs from gut, liver, or portal lymph nodes and hepatic stellate cells were used to activate CD8 T cells. Imprinting of CCR9 and alpha4beta7 and functional migration responses were determined. Crossover activation protocols assessed plasticity of gut homing.\\ Activation by gut DCs imprinted high levels of functional CCR9 and alpha4beta7 on naïve CD8 T cells, whereas hepatic DCs and stellate cells proved inferior. Imprinting was RA dependent and demonstrated plasticity.\\ Imprinting and plasticity of gut-homing human CD8 T cells requires primary activation or reactivation by gut DCs and is retinoic acid dependent. The inability of liver DCs to imprint gut tropism implies that alpha4beta7+CCR9+ T cell that infiltrate the liver in PSC are primed in the gut.}

   Abstract={Liver disease is now the fifth commonest cause of death in the United Kingdom and the incidence is increasing. Chronic injury to the liver typically due to toxic insult, viral infection, immunological or metabolic diseases usually results in a stereotypical response with both parenchymal regeneration and wound healing. Chronic hepatic injury results in liver fibrosis with eventual progression to cirrhosis and end stage liver disease. At this point the majority of the clinical complications arise such as portal hypertension and the development of liver cancer. If the causative disease can be effectively treated the liver can regenerate and at the least partial resolution of liver fibrosis may occur. Unfortunately, unless the primary disease can be eradicated there are no specific anti-fibrotic treatments in routine clinical use. This highlights the urgent need to both increase our understanding of the mechanisms of hepatic fibrogenesis and to develop novel therapies to arrest or reverse the fibrotic process. This article initially outlines the main cellular pathway of fibrogenesis within the liver-the activation of the quiescent hepatic stellate cell into an activated myofibroblast phenotype, resulting in the production of fibrillar collagen. We will then discuss newly emerging sources of scar forming cells during hepatic injury together with the role of hepatic macrophages which have a regulatory function in both the formation and resolution of liver fibrosis.}

   Abstract={Alternative macrophage activation is implicated in diverse disease pathologies such as asthma, organ fibrosis, and granulomatous diseases, but the mechanisms underlying macrophage programming are not fully understood. Galectin-3 is a carbohydrate-binding lectin present on macrophages. We show that disruption of the galectin-3 gene in 129sv mice specifically restrains IL-4/IL-13-induced alternative macrophage activation in bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro and in resident lung and recruited peritoneal macrophages in vivo without affecting IFN-gamma/LPS-induced classical activation or IL-10-induced deactivation. IL-4-mediated alternative macrophage activation is inhibited by siRNA-targeted deletion of galectin-3 or its membrane receptor CD98 and by inhibition of PI3K. Increased galectin-3 expression and secretion is a feature of alternative macrophage activation. IL-4 stimulates galectin-3 expression and release in parallel with other phenotypic markers of alternative macrophage activation. By contrast, classical macrophage activation with LPS inhibits galectin-3 expression and release. Galectin-3 binds to CD98, and exogenous galectin-3 or cross-linking CD98 with the mAb 4F2 stimulates PI3K activation and alternative activation. IL-4-induced alternative activation is blocked by bis-(3-deoxy-3-(3-methoxybenzamido)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl) sulfane, a specific inhibitor of extracellular galectin-3 carbohydrate binding. These results demonstrate that a galectin-3 feedback loop drives alternative macrophage activation. Pharmacological modulation of galectin-3 function represents a novel therapeutic strategy in pathologies associated with alternatively activated macrophages.}

   Abstract={The Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia worldwide, resulting in high mortality. Our in vivo studies show that galectin-3(-/-) mice develop more severe pneumonia after infection with S. pneumoniae, as demonstrated by increased bacteremia and lung damage compared to wild-type mice and that galectin-3 reduces the severity of pneumococcal pneumonia in part by augmenting neutrophil function. Specifically, we show that 1) galectin-3 directly acts as a neutrophil-activating agent and potentiates the effect of fMLP, 2) exogenous galectin-3 augments neutrophil phagocytosis of bacteria and delays neutrophil apoptosis, 3) phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by galectin-3(-/-) macrophages is less efficient compared to wild type, and 4) galectin-3 demonstrates bacteriostatic properties against S. pneumoniae in vitro. Furthermore, ad-back of recombinant galectin-3 in vivo protects galectin-3-deficient mice from developing severe pneumonia. Together, these results demonstrate that galectin-3 is a key molecule in the host defense against pneumococcal infection. Therapeutic strategies designed to augment galectin-3 activity may both enhance inflammatory cell function (by directly affecting neutrophil responsiveness and prolonging neutrophil longevity) and have direct bacteriostatic activity, improving clinical outcomes after severe pneumococcal infection.}

   Abstract={Macrophages have been proposed as a key cell type in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis; however, the mechanism by which macrophages drive fibrosis is still unclear. We show that expression of galectin-3, a beta-galactoside-binding lectin, is up-regulated in a mouse model of progressive renal fibrosis (unilateral ureteric obstruction, UUO), and absence of galectin-3 protects against renal myofibroblast accumulation/activation and fibrosis. Furthermore, specific depletion of macrophages using CD11b-DTR mice reduces fibrosis severity after UUO demonstrating that macrophages are key cells in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. Disruption of the galectin-3 gene does not affect macrophage recruitment after UUO, or macrophage proinflammatory cytokine profiles in response to interferon-gamma/lipopolysaccharide. In addition, absence of galectin-3 does not affect transforming growth factor-beta expression or Smad 2/3 phosphorylation in obstructed kidneys. Adoptive transfer of wild-type but not galectin-3(-/-) macrophages did, however, restore the fibrotic phenotype in galectin-3(-/-) mice. Cross-over experiments using wild-type and galectin-3(-/-) macrophage supernatants and renal fibroblasts confirmed that secretion of galectin-3 by macrophages is critical in the activation of renal fibroblasts to a profibrotic phenotype. Therefore, we demonstrate for the first time that galectin-3 expression and secretion by macrophages is a major mechanism linking macrophages to the promotion of renal fibrosis.}

JNK inhibition in vivo (using two JNK inhibitors with different mechanisms of action) markedly reduced mortality in murine paracetamol hepatotoxicity, with a significant reduction in hepatic necrosis and apoptosis. In addition, delayed administration of the JNK inhibitor was more effective than N-acetylcysteine after paracetamol poisoning in mice. JNK inhibition was not protective in acute carbon tetrachloride-mediated or anti-Fas antibody-mediated hepatic injury, suggesting specificity for the role of JNK in paracetamol hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, disruption of the JNK1 or JNK2 genes did not protect against paracetamol-induced hepatic damage. Pharmacological JNK inhibition had no effect on paracetamol metabolism, but markedly inhibited hepatic tumour necrosis foctor alpha (TNF alpha) production after paracetamol poisoning.\\ These data demonstrated a central role for JNK in the pathogenesis of paracetamol-induced liver failure, thereby identifying JNK as an important therapeutic target in the treatment of paracetamol hepatotoxicity.}

   Abstract={Increased proinflammatory mediators and ECM deposition are key features of the airways in asthma. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are produced by airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells and have multiple roles in inflammation and tissue remodeling. We hypothesized that components of the asthmatic airway would stimulate MMP production and activation by ASM and contribute to airway remodeling. We measured human ASM-derived MMP mRNA, protein, and activity by real-time RT-PCR, zymography, Western blotting, and MMP activity assay. Collagen I and thrombin caused a synergistic increase in MMP-2 protein and total MMP activity but paradoxically decreased MMP-2 mRNA. Additionally, collagen I activated MMP-2 in culture supernatants independent of the cell surface. Together, collagen I and thrombin strongly enhanced MMP-14 mRNA and protein but had no effect individually, suggesting increased MMP-14, the activating protease for MMP-2, may be partially responsible for MMP-2 activation. Furthermore, collagen I reduced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 protein (TIMP-2). We examined the role of MMPs in functions of ASM related to airway remodeling and found migration and proliferation were MMP dependent, whereas adhesion and apoptosis were not. Ilomastat inhibited migration by 25%, which was also inhibited by TIMPs 1-4 and increased by the MMP-2 activator thrombin. These in vitro findings suggest that the environment within the airways of patients with asthma enhances MMP-2 and -14 protein and activity by a complex interaction of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, which may contribute to ASM migration.}

This work is likely to inform the design of effective antifibrotic therapies in the near future. In this review, we examine how the innate and adaptive immune response interacts with other key cell types in the liver, such as the myofibroblast, regulating the process of hepatic fibrosis and, where relevant, resolution of fibrosis with remodelling. Emphasis is placed on the increasing knowledge that has been generated by the use of transgenic animals and animals in which specific cell lines have been deleted. Additionally, we review the increasing evidence that, although significant numbers of wound-healing myofibroblasts are derived from the hepatic stellate cell, significant contributions may occur from other cell lineages, including those from distant sites such as bone marrow stem cells.}

   Abstract={Central to fibrogenesis and the scarring of organs is the activation of fibroblasts into matrix-secreting myofibroblasts. We demonstrate that Galectin-3 expression is up-regulated in established human fibrotic liver disease and is temporally and spatially related to the induction and resolution of experimental hepatic fibrosis. Disruption of the Galectin-3 gene blocks myofibroblast activation and procollagen (I) expression in vitro and in vivo, markedly attenuating liver fibrosis. Addition of exogenous recombinant Galectin-3 in vitro reversed this abnormality. The reduction in hepatic fibrosis observed in the Galectin-3(-/-) mouse occurred despite equivalent liver injury and inflammation, and similar tissue expression of TGF-beta. TGF-beta failed to transactivate Galectin-3(-/-) hepatic stellate cells, in contrast with WT hepatic stellate cells; however, TGF-beta-stimulated Smad-2 and -3 activation was equivalent. These data suggest that Galectin-3 is required for TGF-beta mediated myofibroblast activation and matrix production. Finally, in vivo siRNA knockdown of Galectin-3 inhibited myofibroblast activation after hepatic injury and may therefore provide an alternative therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis.}

In addition, the CCl(4) model is the best characterized with respect to histological, biochemical, cell, and molecular changes associated with the development of fibrosis. CCl(4) can be given intraperitoneally or by oral gavage; it induces zone III necrosis and hepatocyte apoptosis with associated hepatic stellate cell activation and tissue fibrosis. With repetitive dosing CCl(4) can be used to induce bridging hepatic fibrosis (4 wk of twice-weekly dosing), cirrhosis (8 wk of twice-weekly dosing) and advanced micronodular cirrhosis (12 wk of twice-weekly dosing). In addition, for each of these models spontaneous recovery from fibrosis can be studied after cessation of dosing. Mechanistic studies using gene knockout and transgenic animals can also be established using CCl(4). Together these models have provided unparalleled insights into the mechanisms underlying hepatic fibrosis.}

   Abstract={CD98hc (SLC3A2) constitutively and specifically associates with beta(1) integrins and is highly expressed on the surface of human tumor cells irrespective of the tissue of origin. We have found here that expression of CD98hc promotes both anchorage- and serum-independent growth. This oncogenic activity is dependent on beta(1) integrin-mediated phosphoinositol 3-hydroxykinase stimulation and the level of surface expression of CD98hc. Using chimeras of CD98hc and the type II membrane protein CD69, we show that the transmembrane domain of CD98hc is necessary and sufficient for integrin association in cells. Furthermore, CD98hc/beta(1) integrin association is required for focal adhesion kinase-dependent phosphoinositol 3-hydroxykinase activation and cellular transformation. Amino acids 82-87 in the putative cytoplasmic/transmembrane region appear to be critical for the oncogenic potential of CD98hc and provide a novel mechanism for tumor promotion by integrins. These results explain how high expression of CD98hc in human cancers contributes to transformation; furthermore, the transmembrane association of CD98hc and beta(1) integrins may provide a new target for cancer therapy.}

   Abstract={Airway remodelling is a feature of chronic asthma comprising smooth muscle hypertrophy and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) breakdown ECM, are involved in tissue remodelling and have been implicated in airway remodelling. Although mesenchymal cells are an important source of MMPs, little data are available on airway smooth muscle (ASM) derived MMPs. We therefore investigated MMP and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) production and activity in human ASM cells. MMPs and TIMPs were examined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, zymography and a quench fluorescence (QF) assay of total MMP activity. The most abundant MMPs were pro-MMP-2, pro- MMP-3, active MMP-3 and MT1-MMP. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression was low in cell lysates but high in conditioned medium. High TIMP secretion was confirmed by the ability of ASM-conditioned medium to inhibit recombinant MMP-2 in a QF assay. Thrombin increased MMP activity by activation of pro-MMP-2 independent of the conventional smooth muscle thrombin receptors PAR 1 and 4. In conclusion, ASM cells express pro-MMP-2, pro and active MMP-3, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP. Unstimulated cells secrete excess TIMP 1 and 2, preventing proteolytic activity. MMP-2 can be activated by thrombin which may contribute to airway remodelling.}

   Abstract={Many new chemokines have been described in recent years, resulting in a new classification of these chemoattractant proteins. The characterization of the biological functions of most chemokines relates to their ability to induce chemotaxis in circulating inflammatory cells. However, it is now clear that chemokines have a much wider biological role, including angiogenesis, carcinogenesis and involvement in the pathogenesis of HIV infection. Our understanding of the role of chemokines in the pathogenesis of disorders of the lungs and brain outstrips that with regard to disorders of the liver. An increased understanding of the role of chemokines in the pathogenesis of liver disease may lead to the development of novel therapies for hepatic disease.}
