title: Multimodal decoding of human liver regeneration
description: We use paired single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) combined with spatial profiling of healthy and ALF explant human livers to generate the first single-cell, pan-lineage atlas of human liver regeneration. Our work dissects unanticipated aspects of liver regeneration, demonstrating an uncoupling of wound closure and hepatocyte proliferation and uncovering a novel migratory hepatocyte subpopulation which mediates wound closure following liver injury.
