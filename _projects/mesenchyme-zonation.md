title: Single-Cell Transcriptomics Uncovers Zonation of Function in the Mesenchyme during Liver Fibrosis
description: We use single-cell RNA sequencing to deconvolve the hepatic mesenchyme in healthy and fibrotic mouse liver, revealing spatial zonation of HSCs across the hepatic lobule. Our work illustrates the power of single-cell transcriptomics to resolve the key collagen-producing cells driving liver fibrosis with high precision.
