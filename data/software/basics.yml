description: "BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data) is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model to perform statistical analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets in the context of supervised experiments (where the groups of cells of interest are known a priori, e.g. experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS performs built-in data normalisation (global scaling) and technical noise quantification. BASiCS also provides probabilistic frameworks for (i) highly (or lowly) variable genes within a single group of cells and (ii) differential expression analyses (mean and variability) between groups of cells."
