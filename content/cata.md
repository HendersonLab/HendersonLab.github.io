<!--
I am a , where I lead the
Biomedical Data Science research group. I am also a Fellow of 

Before moving to Edinburgh, I was part of the original cohort of Research 
Fellows at The Alan Turing Institute, affiliated to the [UCL Department of 
Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/). As part of my Fellowship, I was also a Group Leader within the Lloyds Register Foundation-Turing Programme on Data-Centric Engineering (until Nov 2017). 
Before joining the Turing (October 2016), I was a joint Postdoctoral Researcher as part of the research groups led by Prof Sylvia Richardson (MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge) and Dr John Marioni (EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute & Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute). My research focused on the development, implementation and application of Bayesian statistical methodology in the context of single cell gene expression data.
Before moving to Cambridge, I was a PhD student at the Department of Statistics of the University of Warwick, under the supervision of Prof Mark Steel. My PhD thesis covered theoretical and practical aspects of Bayesian inference and survival analysis. Previously, I did a BSc in Mathematics (Statistics track, Minor in Economics) at the Faculty of Mathematics of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Additionally, I completed a MSc in Statistics at the same university. My dissertation project related to long memory time times, under the supervision of Prof Wilfredo Palma.
